    "\n",
    "Decoherence Rate: Depends on environmental coupling strength and temperature, with stronger coupling leading to faster decoherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Insight\n",
    "The fundamental distinction is that coherence represents the quantum nature of a system - its ability to exist in superposition and exhibit quantum interference - while decoherence represents the transition toward classical behavior through environmental entanglement. Coherence is what makes quantum technologies powerful, while decoherence is what makes them fragile and challenging to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and controlling this coherence-decoherence balance is crucial for developing practical quantum technologies, as researchers work to extend coherence times while minimizing decoherence effects through better isolation, error correction, and environmental control"
